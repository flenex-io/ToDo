# To-Do App

This To-Do app is a simple project built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Enter a task in the input field and press enter or click the 'Add' button to add it to the list.
- **Complete Tasks:** Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually differentiated from active tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove a task from the list by clicking the delete button next to the task.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## File Structure

- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
